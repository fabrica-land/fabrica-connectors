# Fabrica Trust Agreement

This Trust Agreement (*“Agreement”*) is entered into by the Grantor via minting an NFT on the Fabrica Smart Contract. The relevant information of this trust (the "Trust"), including the Trust Name, is available and can be found in the NFT Metadata. The Trust is entered into at the time the [Fabrica Mint] transaction has been confirmed on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Recitals

- Whereas blockchain smart contracts allow for a secure and interoperable way of tracking ownership of digital assets through use of an electronic legdger to immutably track, document and verify all transactions. As a consequence, new platforms and methods are being developed to store and transact on real assets.
- Whereas the grantor wants to connect/tie ownership of the real property to the NFT so as to benefit from fully digital operations.
- Whereas on issuance of the NFT, the grantor has attached this Agreement to act as the operating agreement of the entity holding the real property. For the purpose of standardization, the grantor and any subsequent party to this agreement intend to keep all the identifing information of this Agreement stored in the NFT to which this contract has been attached. All the operations, definitions and procedures related to the NFT and this Agreement will be stored in this Agreement.
- Whereas the nature of this Trust is to allow the Beneficiary to utilize blockchain technology to manage their ownership of the subject property and facilitate any future transfer of beneficial ownership. The Trustee has the power and authority to deal with the subject property only to the extent directed by the Beneficiary, who otherwise holds all economic and beneficial rights to the subject property. The Beneficiary (who may change from time to time and is at all times defined as the person/entity presently in possession of the NFT) is entitled to income, maintains the sole right of termination, and is treated as the owner of the subject property for all federal, state and local tax purposes. 
- Whereas the parties intend to treat all operations done via blockchain as final, similarly to those performed in traditional real estate transactions. Further, the parties intend and agree to treat digital signatures with the same legal consequence of wet signatures.
- Now, therefore, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

## 1. Trust Purpose ##

1. The purpose of the trust is to create and maintain a link between ownership of the Property and the NFT on the Ethereum Blockchain, so as to allow for the time efficient, cost effective, accurate, and secure ownership, transfer, use and enjoyment of real property title in the digital environment. On creation, the Trust will take and hold title to the Property, and ownership of the Trust will be represented by ownership of the NFT. Regardless of the sale, hypothecation, or other transfer of the NFT, title to the Property will remain in the Trust until such time as the then-present Beneficiary (or another authorized third party) executes the `burn` function and, by doing so, removes the property from the Trust.
2. The owner(s) of the Account holding the NFT shall be the Beneficiary of the Trust, and have the right to appoint the Trustee. All rights and obligations in this agreement shall at all times be linked to the holder of the NFT, such that rightful possession of the NFT gives the holder full and total beneficial ownership.

### 4. Contribution into trust / trust creation

1. Discuss mechanism for trust creation + granting property into the trust
2. Need clarity here on lazy mint mechanism

### 5. Grantor rights and representations

1. The Grantor is the creator of the Trust and is responsible for funding of the Property into the Trust following creation. Following creation and funding of the Trust, the Grantor (except in his capacity as Trustee/Beneficiary) will have no rights regarding the Trust Property, the Digital Title, or the management of the Trust, and will not retain any voting, director appointment, consent, approval or management rights with respect to the Trust Property or the Trust. Further, Grantor will not have any right to require the Beneficiary or Trustee to consult with Grantor with respect to the exercise of such rights and neither the Beneficiary nor the Trustee is required to consult with Grantor with respect to such rights, and the Grantor will have no right to remove or to replace the Beneficiary or Trustee. For purposes of this Agreement, the Trust is not deemed to be an affiliate of Grantor or of any of Grantor’s affiliates.
2. Immediately Prior to Grantor’s conveyance of the Property into the Trust, Grantor represents and warrants:
   1. That Grantor has the full right, power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement and to perform all covenants and agreements of Grantor hereunder.

   7. There are no service contracts, maintenance or management agreements, commission or brokerage agreements, or other similar agreements affecting the Property.

### 6. Beneficiary Rights

1. The Beneficiary is authorized: (1) to execute any function via the Fabrica Smart Contract regarding any decision made by the Beneficiary with respect to the NFT, the Property, and the Trust, including but not limited to transfer, lease, encumbrance, or partial or total sale of the NFT, transfer, lock or utilization of the NFT within any Contract Account, or any other legal and available activity with respect to ownership of property represented by a digital token; and, (2) to dissolve the Trust and [**instruct the Trustee**] to distribute the Property as more fully described in [**section**].
2. The Beneficiary shall possess beneficial enjoyment to and from the Property, including the right of possession, right of control, right of exclusion, right of enjoyment and right of disposition, subject to the provisions of the Trust. The Beneficiary shall have the right to borrow against the NFT . The Beneficiary is entitled to all net income and receipts from the Property from whatever source, and is responsible for any debts or liabilities arising out of the Property or ownership of the NFT. All net income accrued or undistributed at the termination of any interest shall be treated as if it had accrued or been received immediately after that termination. All of the above Beneficiary rights and entitlements are referred to herein as the “**Owner Rights**." 
3. The Owner Rights should be considered absolute, sole and uncontrolled, except to the extent that such Owner Rights are in conflict with the other provisions of this Agreement.

### 7. NFT Transfer

1. The Beneficiary may transfer the Owner Rights by transferring the NFT to another Account through execution of the [`transfer`] function on the Fabrica Smart Contract. When the NFT transfers to a new Account, the owner of that Account shall become the new beneficiary of the Trust, and will also either become the new trustee or specify the new trustee. Transfer of the NFT shall effectuate the full assignment of all interests, rights, duties, liabilities and obligations under the Trust. Therefore, use of the terms “Trustee” and “Beneficiary” within this Agreement shall reference the present interest trustee and present interest beneficiary, as such are identified by the record of the NFT as maintained by the Fabrica Smart Contract on Ethereum. 
2. The Trustee shall only serve as long as the Beneficiary is the Beneficiary of the Trust, and on transfer of the NFT, the prior trustee is replaced by the transferee trustee.
3. The Beneficiary may also transfer the NFT to a Contract Account, for example for the purpose of collateralizing or fractionalizing (among other activities) the NFT. The Digital Title may transfer to multiple Contract Addresses, prior to being returned to the Beneficiary’s Ethereum Address or to an alternative User Address. Such transfers do not necessarily cause an assignment of the Trust. Instead, the Beneficiary and Trustee will remain in their position until such time, if ever, that ownership of the NFT transfers to an Account with a new owner, or the Beneficiary effectuates an assignment of the Owner Rights in some other fashion.
4. All information about the chain of Accounts and Contract Addresses that have interacted with the NFT, as well as the present owner Account, will always be stored on the Fabrica Smart Contract.

### . Trustee obligations, fees and indemnification

1. The Trustee shall:
   1. act as the representative of the Trust at the behest of the Beneficiary, and manage the Property of the Trust consistent with the terms of this Agreement;
   2. prepare, execute, and deliver any documents related to the continued existence of the Trust as well as in connection with any transfer of the NFT or any [**Dissolution Event as defined in section**];
   3. have no duty or liability to the Grantor or Beneficiary with respect to any change in value of any of the Property during the life of the Trust, nor shall the Trustee be liable to any prior or subsequent beneficiary or trustee, except to the extent such liability is created by any private agreement [or by the willful actions of the Trustee]; and,
   4. not be required to furnish a bond or other security in any jurisdiction for the faithful performance of its duties.


### . No individual ownership; Trust Proceeds

1. Title to all of the assets of the Trust shall be vested in the Trust until the Trust dissolves; provided, however, that if the applicable laws of any jurisdiction require that title to any part of the assets of the Trust be vested in a party to the Trust, then title to that part of the assets of the Trust shall be vested in the Beneficiary to the extent so required, with such vested title remaining subject, however, to the assignment and transfer provisions of [**section**].
1. In the event of any disposition involving all or part of the Property, the proceeds of such distribution, whether in the form of cash, property or securities, will be distributed to the Beneficiary, or any other person or entity designated by the Beneficiary to receive such distribution. In the event that dividends or distributions are paid in respect of any portion of the Trust Property, all of such dividends or distributions shall be distributed to the Beneficiary as soon as practicable following receipt of any such dividends or distributions, whether in the form of cash, property or securities.

### . Trust modifications/amendments

1. This Agreement may be modified by the Beneficiary at any time by [running the `update` function or] attaching the updated agreement to the NFT. While the NFT metadata will only display the most current operating agreement, the history of the Agreement will be stored on Ethereum, and remain publicly available. [fede note: I'm still undecided on this. it's potentially quite risky and a possible vector to rug ppl. on the other hand, not allowing upgradability would froze the property in the agreement version used at minting time, and updates would require an unconvenient tranfer to a new NFT]

### . Trust termination

1. The process for dissolving the Trust is as follows (“**Dissolution Event**”):
   1. (1) first, the Trustee shall provide notice to the Fabrica Smart Contract by [**process**]; (2) next, divestiture/removal of the Property and any other additional remaining trust property from the Trust.

2. The proceeds from any sale or disposition of the Property and any other remaining trust property shall be paid to the Beneficiary.
3. Throughout the life of the Trust, the Grantor holds no right of termination, nor is any termination subject to the life of Grantor or any decision or action taken by the Grantor.
4. [In the event of lost keys, theft of keys, Beneficiary shall take the following steps to protect lawful title to the property:]

### . Miscellaneous

1. If any part of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or writing given pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, said part shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity only, without in any way affecting the remaining part of said provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
2. The headings of the sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and do not form a part or affect the meaning hereof. Wherever used herein, a pronoun in any gender shall be considered as including any other gender pronoun. References to the singular include the plural, and vice versa.
3. To the extent it is not contrary to a strong public policy of the jurisdiction, if any, having a more significant relationship to this Agreement, this Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties hereto, and any claims and disputes relating thereto, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (not including the choice of law rules thereof).
4. The parties to this Agreement hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any State or Federal Court of competent jurisdiction located within the State of California, in the County of San Francisco, in connection with any actions or proceedings arising directly or indirectly from this Agreement.
