Fabrica Trust Agreement

 

\1.   Opening statement

a.   This Trust Agreement (“Agreement”) for the [serialized] Fabrica Trust (this “Trust”) is entered into through a Token Mint by the Grantor. The Trust Name, Creation Date, and other Trust identifiers and Agreement are found in the [function/NFT] to which this Agreement has been linked.

b.   **Trying to figure out best way to state along the lines: this trust agreement is effective when the function related to the trust being created is called (not sure if that’s mint or a post mint function)**

\2.   Trust Purpose

a.   The purpose of the trust is to hold title to the trust property. The owner of the wallet holding the NFT shall be the beneficial owner of the trust, and have the right to name the trustee [again, via a function in the contract?]

b.   All rights and obligations in this agreement shall at all times be linked to the holder of the NFT, such that rightful possession of the NFT gives the holder [full and total] beneficial ownership.
