# Connectors
Connectors are legal frameworks, also known as operating agreements, that bridge the gap between real property rights and their digital representations as onchain assets.

The connectors repository houses agreements used to create either entity or non-entity wrappers. These wrappers hold and represent real property rights onchain. A variety of methods have been theorized and utilized across attempts to digitze property rights. This collection currently contains a single operating agreement, the [Fabrica Trust](connectors/us/), which has been under continuous development by Fabrica since 2017. Looking ahead, we plan to expand our repository with additional connectors tailored to different use cases and legal jurisdictions.

A critical attribute of a connector is its capability to seamlessly link a physical property to an onchain asset. This link ensures that the owner of the digital asset has complete control over and access to the corresponding property. While methods and control styles may vary, the most effective connectors establish a connection between property and token such that owning the token equates to owning the property, without the need for third-party notifications, filings, or additional actions post-setup.
