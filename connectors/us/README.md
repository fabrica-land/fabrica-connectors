# Fabrica Trust Agreement

A lightweight and innovative method for wrapping real estate and representing title onchain.

The Fabrica Trust is a legal structure designed by Fabrica to hold real property and represent its ownership on onchain. The Fabrica Trust has been refined through numerous updates, incorporating legal and technological insights over 7 years of experience tokenizing title.

The Fabrica Trust has been used across hundreds of properties in a variety of states. While its application has been primarily within the United States, efforts are underway to extend its use for digitizing title in other jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally.

# Structure and Functionality

The Fabrica Trust operates as a nominee trust, where the token holder is always the beneficiary. This beneficiary is the owner of the property and ultimately responsible for all benefits and obligations of ownership. The trust is designed to hold a single piece of property but could be altered to hold multiple properties or multiple types of properties.

The trust's design allows the beneficiary to use blockchain technology for managing property ownership and executing transactions—both conventional and novel—directly onchain. Because the purpose of the trust is to facilitate the use of blockchain technology, the beneficiary may also serve as the trustee, leaving no doubt that the subject property is owned by the token holder.

# Key Terms

- Mere Titleholder - The trustee serves solely as the titleholder, with responsibilities limited to managing the trust property at the direction of the beneficiary.

- Right to Economic Benefit - The beneficiary holds all economic and beneficial rights to the property, including all net income and receipts from any source whatsoever.

- Termination - The beneficiary can terminate the trust and reclaim legal title to the property by burning the associated token and directing the trustee to transfer the property out of the trust.

- Ownership for Tax Purposes - The beneficiary is treated as the owner of the property for all federal, state and local tax purposes.
